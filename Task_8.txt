   Proton VPN Setup Steps (Desktop)

1. Create an Account:
   Go to [protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com) and sign up for a free or paid account.

2. Download the App
   Download Proton VPN for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

3. Install the App
   Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install.

4. Log In
   Open the app and log in using your Proton account credentials.

5. Connect to a Server

   * Choose a country/server from the list.
   * Click Connect.
   * Wait for the connection to be established.



--> Checking Connection Status

    On the Proton VPN App:

* Once connected, the app will show:

  * A green "Connected" status.
  * The IP address you're using.
  * The server location.
  * Connection time and protocol used.

 On Windows (Alternative Method):

1. Open "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell".

2. Type:

   ```
   ipconfig
   ```

    Check the IP to see if it's different from your original ISP-assigned IP.

3. You can also use:

   ```
   curl ifconfig.me
   ```

   (requires curl to be installed)

4. Or visit a website like `https://whatismyipaddress.com` to confirm that your IP has changed and location is masked.




===> VPN Setup and Analysis Report

1. Chose a Free VPN Service and Signed Up:
   I selected Proton VPN as it is a reputable and trusted VPN provider offering a free plan with no data limit and a strong focus on privacy.
   I created an account on their official website.

2. Downloaded and Installed the VPN Client:
   After signing up, I downloaded the Proton VPN desktop client for Windows from their website.
   The installation process was straightforward and completed without issues.

3. Connected to a VPN Server:
   Once logged in, I connected to the "ROMANIA" server, which was among the available free servers.
   The connection was established successfully within a few seconds.

4. Verified IP Address Change:
   To confirm that the VPN was working, I visited [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com). 
   The site showed a different IP address and location (Romania), verifying that my real IP was hidden.

5. Browsed a Website to Confirm Encryption:
   I opened a secure website ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick])) and confirmed that it loaded properly using HTTPS. 
   This confirmed that my traffic was encrypted while the VPN was active.

6. Disconnected VPN and Compared Speed and IP:
   After browsing, I disconnected the VPN and checked the IP again using the same website. It showed my original IP and location.
   I also noticed that browsing was slightly faster without the VPN, especially while loading media-heavy sites.

7. Researched VPN Encryption and Privacy Features:
   I researched Proton VPNâ€™s security features. It uses "AES-256-bit" encryption, supports "OpenVPN" and WireGuard protocols, and follows a strict no-logs policy. 
   The company is based in "Switzerland", a country known for strong privacy laws.

8. Summary: VPN Benefits and Limitations:

   -> Benefits:

   * Hides real IP address and location.
   * Encrypts internet traffic, improving security on public Wi-Fi.
   * Helps bypass region restrictions and censorship.
   * Enhances online anonymity and privacy.

   -> Limitations:

   * Free servers can be slower or congested.
   * Some websites block traffic from known VPN IPs.
   * Slight drop in internet speed due to encryption.
   * Actual privacy depends on the VPN provider's trustworthiness.

Thank you.
